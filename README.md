Hello everyone!

My name is Eddie Caraballo, Computer Science graduate from FIU and currently going for my Masters of Science in Computer Science!

This repo contains a collection projects I've worked on throughout the since my interest in Computer Science bloomed in 2012, both for school and on the side.

Please enjoy!
